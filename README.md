<h1 align="center">Every day A Waifu</h1>
<p align="center">ðŸ’– The Twitter bot that posts every day a different waifu to brighten your day.</p>

## Adding a waifu:
Fork the repository, and clone to your PC, I recommend that you download the image of the waifu you want from Anilist, but whatever, download it and name it in the folder ``images`` in order, then add it to ``waifus/index.json`` following the standard of the other waifus and wow! Just give a pull request.
