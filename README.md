## Adding a waifu:
Fork the repository, and clone to your PC, I recommend that you download the image of the waifu you want from Anilist, but whatever, download it and name it in the folder ``images`` in order, then add it to ``waifus/index.json`` following the standard of the other waifus and wow! Just give a pull request.
